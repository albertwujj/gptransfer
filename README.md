Ok, maybe not literally a single click. How to reproduce:

1. Be logged in with Google.
2. Go to: https://colab.research.google.com/github/albertwujj/gptransfer/blob/master/gpshare.ipynb
3. Have at least 3.5 gigabytes of space left on your Google Drive.
   The notebook will download a 3.14 GB folder to 'My Drive/ColabExperiments1921'
4. Switch to GPU under 'Runtime' -> 'Change runtime type'
5. Run all cells
6. Enter auth code as prompted
